Gamepads are recommended for best experience, but you can use the arrow keys to control player 1, and w, a, s, and d keys to move player 4.

## Gamepad support

This game supports several gamepad controllers including Playstation 3 and Playstation 4. Just connect the controller to your computer using a USB cable. The left stick controls ship movement while the right stick moves the turret and fires your weapon.
