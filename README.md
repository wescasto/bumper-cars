## Running the game on MacOS

1. In terminal, navigate to the bumper-cars folder and run a webserver:

        python -m SimpleHTTPServer

2. Open your browser at localhost:8000

## Playing the game

Players must hit the orange puck into their opponent's goal to score. The team with the most goals before time runs out wins. *Note: this game requires at least one gamepad controller to move players. It's also a work in progress so many of the mechanics are still incomplete!*

## Gamepad support

This game supports several gamepad controllers including Playstation 3 and Playstation 4. Just connect the controller to your computer using a USB cable. The left stick controls ship movement while the right stick moves the turret and fires your weapon.

This game was built using PhaserJS (v2.6.2). See more at https://phaser.io/
